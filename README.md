# Generating guitar solos by ingeter programming

The system described here uses integer programming models in order to generate guitar solos, more precisely a 12-Bar Blues progression. The 12-Bar Blues progression is a sequence of 12 measures following a harmony based on the I, IV and V chors of a key.

A solo is generated measure by measure, and each measure is generated note by note. This problem can be viewed as a variant of the traveling salesman problem (TSP).
